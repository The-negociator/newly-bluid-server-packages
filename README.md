Given Projects:

 A- Everytime a server is built, we realise that some package are missing. This is due to manual installation of packages. write a script that will install those packages. List of packages:

wget
net-utils
sysstat
finger
gcc
make
python3
epel-release
git

B- Installing jenkins is all manual efforts please use the document in confluence on how to install jenkins and see how you can automate it.

C- On the docker main page, there are steps to install docker on centos7 please write a script to automate the installation of docker. https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/

D- Developers are working on html, css,javascript code and to test it, we need to configure an apache server for them. This is manual and takes time also prone to human errors. write a script that can be used to do that automatically

E- The script on package install is failing in ubuntu and alpine flavors please modify the script in project A to make it a little more dynamic.

F- For better collaboration, all these script need to be stored in a vcs. please push all these in repo in github called "newly-bluid-server-packages".
